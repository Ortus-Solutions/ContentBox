I guess it's just personal coding style, but I'd rather make a function have optional parameters and check for their existence than to always expect them and then test them to see what they are.

My days are filled with many hours on the internet, searching for ways to make money, checking the weather (of course), looking for bargains and stuff like that. I think that I may have stumbled upon something of value. Let's face it, if I can make money with this software, so can you. You don't need a website or really any previous experience. The system comes with complete instructions. This thing is called \"Instant Cash Empire\". I think it looks legit and I found the loophole so that you can get this system at a discount. When you go to the sales page listed below, don't order from that page. Instead, just close the window and it will try to make you stay for a different offer. I think is does that 1 or 2 times before you get to the page that offers the discount! (Just keep hitting 'cancel' until you get the discount page). Here is how the package is advertised: The Instant Cash Empire money making system is for people who are looking for an easier way to make money online. Get push button cash sites in just 2 minutes! It not only generates a network of websites for you, but it will also give your network of sites ALL the traffic they could possibly ever need.  The software will get your newly created, push button cash websites free traffic. When you join, you will receive instant access to an automated software that will create your very own \"instant cash empire\" web network of sites working for you 24\/7 to generate cash even while you sleep. With Instant Cash Empire you do not need to master every technical skill before you are able to see REAL results. So if you are looking for a way to make money online and you are all for automation, or you just don't want to have to create your money websites yourself, or you don't want to take the time or spend the money to get traffic to your websites, you might want to check out the Instant Cash Empire push button method for generating income.

But truthfully, this could really help a lot of people who are feeling the pinch from the state of the global economy. The best day of my life was when I quit my 9-5 job, even though it was more of a 3pm to midnight job.  From SEO to PPC to Direct Mail, Classifieds Advertising, posting on blogs, forums, wiki?s and message boards.  Let me just go ahead and tell you what I am getting at. You can make A LOT of money with this system. The guy who put this thing together is obviously quite intelligent and market savvy. He really knows what he is doing when it comes to making money online and he is the real deal. This guy is really something else and this new money making method will keep you up at night with excitement. After you watch the videos, you will see why he has made this an invitation only program (don't worry, I have the invite for you). Using automated software and reverse engineering, you too could soon be raking in the bucks. You will be helping other people make money while making money for yourself. This method can be used by anyone. You don't need to have experience in Internet marketing. A big bonus in this system is that by watching the video modules, you can come up with some other great ideas of your own. I am so glad that I found this system and I am sure that you will too.

I've just had a look at the action script code importer for EA and all it does is build class diagrams.  There doesn't seem to be any ability around logic, as in an activity diagram, so that's disappointing. Most anything legacy (which is where you'd be most likely to want to do this), is unlikely to have nicely formed classes and is more likely to be great reams of logic.   If you get a chance, do have a look at the demo of Visustin.  It's annoying as it's quite crippled, but to see a huge flowchart just appear from a big piece of CF source was quite impressive.  They have two versions, $249 and $499.  The former seems to just grab a diagram which you can print and save, but I don't think edit.  The latter allows editing and annotation, plus export to Visio.

We use the Maven Release Plugin to handle bundle release artifacts and the Cargo Plugin to hot deploy WARs onto Tomcat servers.\r\n\r\nWe've incorporated SQL migrations into our build process using the Carbon-Five DB Migration Plugin for Maven.  Unfortunately, there is no hook for Ant, but there is a Java integration guide (http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/c5-db-migration\/wiki\/ApplicationEmbedding) which could be ported to an Ant task with a little work.  The plugin doesn't support rollbacks, but I'm sure there are folks out there working to extend it ... :)  What's the best about this plugin vs the other Maven and Ant plugins I've encountered, is that based on the JDBC driver added as dependency, it can detect nuisances between DB servers and send out statements correctly for processing.  For example, when scripting an SP for MySQL, you sometimes want to change the delimiter from ; to ;; so you can use semicolons in the SP code itself and not get it confused with an end of statement.  This plugin won't puke on those scripts, whereas I've found that the stock Ant plugin and the Maven SQL plugin will.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, Maven has its pain points when working with tooling for langs other than Java.  I use Ant for my OSS efforts with Flex and have used it with CF with success.   If you're a fan of Groovy, Gradle which is a nice marriage of both worlds, but if it's too much of a shift, GAnt is a great way to get some programmatic features (e.g. - iteration) into Ant without using libraries like AntContrib.\r\n\r\nIf you want a great intro\/overview of this space, check out the Continuous Delivery book in the Fowler series.  I just picked it up and it's a great read.","createddate":"2011-04-06 20:28:27.0","wpcommentpostid":668,"authorip":"205.185.201.10","isapproved":1}"

I've seen him add amazing stuff, and my discussions with him have proven him to be very humble and insightful. \r\n\r\nCould ColdBox still use some work? Sure. Does it have bugs? Yes. I follow his Assembla project, and see him fixing and improving stuff on a daily basis. Luis tends to dream big, and that is why so much changes from milestone to another. \r\n\r\nBut you know all this... and what comes from working with pre-release software...\r\n\r\nSorry - just felt like some line was crossed.

Now, due to changes in our network setup, they copy the file to a jump drive, and copy them up to the prod server and either use beyond compare, or just manually scan the file for the line changes. \r\nI'd really like to hear about ALL the different ways to copy code from dev to prod...what else is there besides ANT?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nDan","createddate":"2011-04-08 04:31:08.0","wpcommentpostid":668,"authorip":"205.167.170.19","isapproved":1}"

After you checked in your work into your branch, and then after it had been approved on dev we would merge our changes in SVN to the staging or production server. We'd then use an ant task to update code on the Staging server. We used a more automated process for production, involving an ant task exporting from the SVN server, getting all the necessary support files (from a CFEnterprise War file), Warring the files together and then using FTP to deliver the WAR file to the deploy directory of a remote Jboss app server. During the next JBoss lifecycle, the app server would notice the changed WAR file and then deploy it to the other members of the cluster.","createddate":"2011-04-08 13:34:29.0","wpcommentpostid":668,"authorip":"204.235.124.36","isapproved":1}"

Got your attention? The best day of my life was when I quit my 9-5 job, even though it was more of a 3pm to midnight job. Needless to say, I have tried just about everything that you could think of. From SEO to PPC to Direct Mail, Classifieds Advertising, posting on blogs, forums, wiki?s and message boards. There are many great reasons why Internet marketing is so much better than punching a time clock. Let me just go ahead and tell you what I am getting at. You can make A LOT of money with this system. The guy who put this thing together is obviously quite intelligent and market savvy. I think that you will find his approach quite refreshing. He just quietly goes about making thousands of dollars a week. After you watch the videos, you will see why he has made this an invitation only program (don't worry, I have the invite for you). The system is set up so that you would only need to work one hour a day but if you're like me, you would probably work it to death in order to maximize your profits. You will be helping other people make money while making money for yourself. This method can be used by anyone. You don't need to have experience in Internet marketing. There are some aspects of this system that are time sensitive so you might want to get in on it as soon as you can. This is a real no-brainer. Take a look at the video presentation and let me know what you think. -&gt; http:\/\/cash411.info\/go\/239","createddate":"2011-06-14 05:19:16.0","wpcommentpostid":468,"authorip":"64.76.2.230","isapproved":false}"

I am an expert at making money online but not everyone will listen to my advice. I quit my job about 11 years ago and have never looked back (I make all my money online). I don't consider my self to be a web guru but I have managed to do pretty well. If there is a money making method out there that I have not tried, I would be quite surprised. There are many great reasons why Internet marketing is so much better than punching a time clock. Let's get to the meat of the matter. You have probably heard this before but this really is nothing like anything that you have seen before. It was put together by someone that I highly respect. He really knows what he is doing when it comes to making money online and he is the real deal. He is obviously very rich and after you take a look at this program you will be able to see why. So I ended up getting a private invitation to his newest ?thing? and I can honestly say that I am quite happy that I decided to at least look into it. It uses reverse engineering of traditional marketing methods in an untapped market and incorporates tools and software to help automate your tasks. The payments on this thing are $200 to $300 a shot. This method can be used by anyone. You don't need to have experience in Internet marketing.  Time is burning so I suggest that you take a look as soon as possible. I really think that this will make a huge difference for you so go take a look at the video. -&gt; http:\/\/cash411.info\/go\/239","createddate":"2011-06-09 00:56:43.0","wpcommentpostid":468,"authorip":"190.202.87.131","isapproved":false}"
