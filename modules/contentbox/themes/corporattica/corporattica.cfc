Templates
Templates are a single cfm template that is used by ContentBox to iterate over a collection (usually entries or categories or comments) and
render out all of them in uniformity.  Please refer to ColdBox Collection Rendering for more information.  Each template recevies
the following:

* _counter (A variable created for you that tells you in which record we are currently looping on)
* _items (A variable created for you that tells you how many records exist in the collection)
* {templateName} The name of the object you will use to display: entry, comment, category

Layout Local CallBack Functions:
onActivation()
onDelete()
onDeactivation()

Settings
You can declare settings for your layouts that ContentBox will manage for you.

this.settings = []

The value is an array of structures with the following keys:

- name : The name of the setting (required), the setting is saved as cb_layoutname_settingName
- defaultValue : The default value of the setting (required)
- required : Whether the setting is required or not. Defaults to false
- type : The type of the HTMl control (text=default, textarea, boolean, select)
- label : The HTML label of the control (defaults to name)
- title : The HTML title of the control (defaults to empty string)
- options : The select box options. Can be a list or array of values or an array of name-value pair structures
